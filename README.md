# nyc-cab
Map-Reduce project using Hadoop on NYC cab data to find:
1. Five most popular routes from the data (a route is defined in terms of pick-up location and
drop-location)
2. Five most expensive routes (most expensive route has the most dollars paid per mile)

Data processed by Hadoop: Yellow cabs in 2010

The NYC cab data is available at www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml
